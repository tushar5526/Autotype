# Autotype üñä

A quick and small python script that helps you autotype on websites that have copy paste disabled like Moodle, HackerEarth contests etc as it is difficult to efficiently debug your code on an online compiler.

### Run it as follows if you are not familiar with CLI apps.
Put the text inside `code` in `Simulator/simulate_keyboard.py` as follows

```
Line 13
code = """
    #include<bits/stdc++.h>
    {
        .
        .
        .
    }
"""
# Make sure to use triple quotes as it will preserve the code format.
```
- Run the script `python3 Simulator/simulate_keyboard.py`
- The script will start typing after 3s (wait or delay time can be tuned)
- After running the script click on the window to move your cursor wherever you want to auto-type.
